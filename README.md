# CS330

In my approach to desinging software I always like to stay organized, focus on tasks at a time,
and strive to keep my code reusable and well commented. Tactics from my current work can be 
applied to future work because I keep my code organized and commented in sections. I was able to
code faster and to understand what I was coding a lot better throughout this class, from the start
I was very lost, and as the weeks went by I felt more and more comfortable.
I think this class will help me a lot in my educational pathway, as well as my profession. Comp graphics
and visualization is no easy class to take, and it shows a load of creativity, effort, and dedication.
Thank you,
